Patient: Hi Dr. Johnson. I've been having this persistent cough for about two weeks now, and it's been getting worse. I'm also feeling quite tired.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about the cough? Is it dry or are you bringing anything up?

Patient: It's mostly dry, but sometimes I do cough up a little bit of clear mucus. It's worse at night and in the morning.

Doctor: Any fever or shortness of breath?

Patient: I had a low-grade fever for a few days last week, but that's gone now. I do feel a bit short of breath when I climb stairs.

Doctor: Any chest pain?

Patient: Not really chest pain, but my chest feels tight sometimes.

Doctor: Let me examine you. Your temperature is normal today at 98.6¬∞F. Blood pressure is 120/80, which is good. Heart rate is 72 beats per minute. Let me listen to your lungs... I can hear some mild wheezing on the right side.

Patient: Is that serious?

Doctor: It could be a respiratory infection or possibly early bronchitis. I'd like to get a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia. I'm also going to prescribe an inhaler to help with the wheezing and a cough suppressant.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good. When should I come back?

Doctor: Let's schedule a follow-up in one week. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a high fever, please come in sooner.""",

Here's a summary of your visit today with Dr. Johnson:

**What you came in for:**
You've had a persistent cough for about 2 weeks that's been getting worse, along with feeling tired. The cough is mostly dry but sometimes brings up clear mucus, and it's worse at night and in the morning.

**What we found:**
Your vital signs look good - normal temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. When Dr. Johnson listened to your lungs, she heard some mild wheezing on the right side. This suggests you might have a respiratory infection or early bronchitis.

**Your treatment plan:**
- We're giving you an inhaler to help with the wheezing
- A cough suppressant to help you feel more comfortable
- We've ordered a chest X-ray to make sure you don't have pneumonia

**What to do next:**
- Come back for a follow-up appointment in one week
- If your symptoms get worse or you develop a high fever, please come in sooner
- Use your medications as directed

**Important:** If you have trouble breathing, severe chest pain, or high fever, don't wait - come in right away or go to the emergency room.

Take care, and we'll see you next week!

Dr. Johnson's Office""",

Patient: Hi Dr. Chen. I've been having really bad headaches for the past month. They're different from my usual headaches.

Doctor: Can you describe how they're different?

Patient: They're much more intense, and they seem to happen every day now. Usually around my temples and forehead. Sometimes I feel nauseous too.

Doctor: On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the pain?

Patient: Usually around 7 or 8. Sometimes it gets so bad I can't concentrate at work.

Doctor: Any triggers you've noticed?

Patient: I think stress might be a factor. I've been working a lot of overtime lately. Also, I haven't been sleeping well.

Doctor: Any vision changes, sensitivity to light?

Patient: Yes, bright lights make it worse. No vision changes though.

Doctor: Let me check your blood pressure... 140/90. That's a bit elevated. How's your blood pressure usually?

Patient: I'm not sure, I don't check it regularly.

Doctor: Any family history of high blood pressure or migraines?

Patient: My mom has high blood pressure, and my sister gets migraines.

Doctor: I'm going to start you on a blood pressure medication and recommend some lifestyle changes. For the headaches, let's try a preventive medication.""",
