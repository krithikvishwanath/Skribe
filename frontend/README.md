# Scribe - AI-Powered Clinical Documentation & Patient Experience Platform

*HackMIT Healthcare Track 2025*

An intelligent multi-agent system that automates clinical documentation, generates SOAP notes, and enhances patient communication - giving physicians their time back while improving healthcare delivery.

## 🏥 The Problem We're Solving

Healthcare providers spend **60-70% of their time** on administrative tasks, with doctors averaging **2-3 hours daily** on transcription and documentation. This $30B+ annual burden reduces patient face-time, increases physician burnout, and degrades the overall healthcare experience.

**Hospital Validation**: We spoke directly with Chiefs of IT at major regional hospitals who confirmed this is their #1 operational pain point and are actively seeking solutions like Scribe for integration.

## 🎯 Our Solution

Scribe transforms clinical workflows through a sophisticated multi-agent AI system that:
- **Transcribes conversations** in real-time with medical context
- **Generates structured SOAP notes** automatically
- **Handles patient communication** and follow-up scheduling
- **Ensures HIPAA compliance** throughout the process
- **Integrates with existing EHR systems** seamlessly
